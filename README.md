## Ultrasound-Nerve-Segmentation

Introduction
---
In this project, we propose an algorithm for
automatic segmentation of nerves in ultrasound images of
the neck. Deep convolutional neural networks, when
trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixel, have demonstrated
incomparable performance for various tasks such as image
classification and object detection. Image segmentation is a
low-level vision task which involves pixel level
classification. Recent techniques which used fully
convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation
have limited the scope for Image Segmentation. In this
project, we demonstrate the use of the U-Net convolutional
architecture for ultrasound nerve segmentation.
